**Analysis of Genetic Variants**

---

## Overview

This project involves a genetic analysis workflow designed to process and analyze genetic data. It utilizes a set of scripts and modules to analyze genetic information, producing reports in multiple formats (including Markdown and DOCX). The project is highly extensible and customizable for various datasets.

---

## Project Organization

The project is organized into several key components, each serving a specific role in the analysis workflow.

## Execution Instructions

### Quick-Run Script

Execute the quick-run script by running the following command in your terminal:

```bash
./20241004_quickrun_gen_analysisV2.sh
```

Confirm the continuation when prompted. The script will activate the necessary environment and start processing the genetic data. The output will be generated in various formats, including Markdown and DOCX reports.

---

### SLURM Job Management

To submit SLURM jobs for the analysis, ensure that you have the correct environment set up by using the provided shell scripts. Submit jobs with the SLURM job scheduler for parallel processing or computational-heavy tasks. You can do this by using the provided `rm_request_open_terminal.sh` script.

## Directory Structure Details

### data/

Contains several test datasets in TSV format to validate the functionality of the scripts. Notable files include:

- `empty.tsv`: An empty test file.
- `extracol.tsv`: A test file with extra columns.
- `header.tsv`: A file with malformed headers.
- `malformed.tsv`: A file with incorrect data formatting.
- `missingcol.tsv`: A file with missing columns.
- `test_file_1.tsv` and `test_file_2.tsv`: Example test datasets.

### gen_analysis_module/

Core source code for data processing and analysis.

- `config.py`: Configures project directories and loads environment variables.
- `dataset.py`: Command-line interface for processing datasets.
- `features.py`: Generates features from datasets.
- `gen_analysis.py`: Main script for genetic analysis.
- `plots.py`: Placeholder for future plotting functions.

---

## Additional Notes

- Ensure that the necessary environment variables are set in the `.env` file before running any scripts.
- The project assumes the use of a Conda environment for dependencies. Make sure that the environment is activated before running the scripts.
- Troubleshooting for SLURM jobs can be found in the `rm_request_open_terminal.sh` script and its documentation.
